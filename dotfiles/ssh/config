# SSH Clipboard: The "clipboard" is a feature of X11, so you will need to enable "X11 forwarding" for the SSH connection in "trusted" mode:
# $ ssh -Y myserver
# (By default, X11 is forwarded in "untrusted" mode, which is somewhat too restrictive. -Y disables the restrictions.)
# Also make sure the server has xauth and a X11-capable version of vim installed. You can use xsel -o and xsel -o -b to verify that the clipboard can be accessed.
# sudo apt-get install -y xsel xauth
Host myserver
    ForwardX11 yes
    ForwardX11Trusted yes
